# APPLIED ML â€” Portfolio (Labs & From-Scratch)

**What this folder is**  
My general ML study area focused on **practical results**: ongoing labs (some short, some multi-week) and **from-scratch** implementations with the underlying math when helpful.

**What to expect**  
- Jupyter notebooks centered on one idea at a time (may span multiple weeks).  
- A visible result per notebook (a metric and/or a simple plot).  
- `NOTES.md`, with brief bullets about what was learned.


**How to run**  
Use the repository root environment (see the main README). Open the notebook in Jupyter and run top-to-bottom.
