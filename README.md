# Machine Learning Study

Personal repository for my study of the book **"Introduction to Machine Learning with Python"** by Andreas C. Müller and Sarah Guido.

I’m reading the book in English to learn machine learning concepts and practice technical English.

For now, it may include notes, experiments, and any other materials I create while studying.
