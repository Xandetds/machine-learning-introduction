# Overfitting vs Underfitting

## Overfitting

Occurs when a model learns **too much detail** from the training data, including noise, and performs poorly on unseen data.

### Signs
- High accuracy on training data, low accuracy on test data.
- Model is overly complex for the amount of data.

---

## Underfitting

Occurs when a model is **too simple** to capture the patterns in the data.

### Signs
- Low accuracy on both training and test data.
- Model fails to generalize because it lacks complexity.

## Balancing Model Complexity

The ideal model:
- Fits the data well without memorizing it.
- Generalizes properly to new inputs.
