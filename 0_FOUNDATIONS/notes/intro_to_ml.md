# Introduction to Machine Learning

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is the field that enables computers to learn patterns from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed.

## Types of Machine Learning

- **Supervised Learning**: uses labeled data (input + output).  
  *Example:* predicting if an email is spam or not.

- **Unsupervised Learning**: uses only inputs, discovering patterns or clusters.  
  *Example:* grouping customers by purchase behavior.

## How the Machine Understands Data

Think of data as a table:
- Each **row** → a sample or entity  
- Each **column** → a feature or property  
- Each **cell** → a value

## Key Concepts

- **Training Data**: used to teach the model.  
- **Test Data**: used to evaluate model performance.  
- **Feature**: an individual measurable property.  
- **Label**: the target value (output).
