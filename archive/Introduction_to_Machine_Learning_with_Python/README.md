This reading track is currently **paused**. I keep these files as reference.

- Documents my first steps and summaries from the book.  
- Useful for quick reminders when revisiting a topic.

**Contents (typical)**  
- Chapter implementation notebooks
- `notes.md` — brief written notes from the reading

**How to run**  
Use the repository root environment (see the main README): create/activate `.venv`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, then open the notebooks in Jupyter.
