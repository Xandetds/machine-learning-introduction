# Notes â€” Introduction to Machine Learning with Python

## Chapter 1

### Types of Machine Learning
*Supervised*: when we provide both **input** and **output** data.  
Example: images of a tumor as input, with the diagnosis and either the tumor is benign or not, as the output.

*Unsupervised*: when we only provide the **input**.
Example: Data of customer entering a store, and the machine identifying the groups with similar preferences.

### How the Machine Understands Data
Thinking of your data as a table:  
- Each **entity** is a row.  
- Each **property** of your entity (like gender or age) is a column.  
- Each row (entity) is called a **sample**.  
- Each column is a **feature**.

### What to Keep in Mind While Building an ML Solution
- What question do I have, and can the data collected answer it?  
- Do I have enough data to represent the problem?  
- Can the features of the data enable the right prediction?  
- How will I measure success in my application?
